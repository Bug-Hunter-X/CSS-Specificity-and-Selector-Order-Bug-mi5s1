The solution is to carefully consider the specificity of your CSS selectors and ensure that the most specific rules are placed later in your stylesheet. Alternatively, use the `!important` flag, though this is generally discouraged because it can lead to maintainability issues.

```css
div p {
  color: red;
}

div.container p {
  color: blue;
}

.container p {
  color: green;
}
```

In this corrected version, the order of the selectors now reflects the specificity; the most specific selector (`div.container p`) will always take precedence. This should resolve the inconsistent styling across different browsers.
